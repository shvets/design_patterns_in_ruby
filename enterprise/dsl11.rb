# dsl11.rb

# Domain Specific Language (DSL) is simple set of commands for serving a specific domain.
# It could be implemented on object or class level. With object level we've got DSL scripts, with
# the class level - meta-programming statements

# This implementation uses object level.

# 1. Defines DSL elements: tree, trunk, branch, root, leaf.
#    If one element appears inside another, use collection and don't forget to eval
#    incoming block for the parent.
