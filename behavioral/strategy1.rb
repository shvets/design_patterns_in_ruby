# strategy1.rb

# Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one and make them interchangeable. 
# Let the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

# 1. strategy implementations

  def operation
    puts 'operation1'
  end
end

class MyStrategy2
  def operation
    puts 'operation2'
  end
end

# 2. strategy context

class StrategyContext
  attr_writer :strategy

  def execute
    @strategy.operation
  end
end

# 3. test

strategy1 = MyStrategy1.new
strategy2 = MyStrategy2.new

context.strategy = strategy1
context.execute
